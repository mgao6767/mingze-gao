# Simple banking book accounting

## A first look at bank's balance sheet 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
To begin with, a simple bank has just been established with shareholders' contribution of $10,000.
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: A new bank has just been established.
# | panel: center
import datetime
from brms.accounting.account import AccountBalances
from brms.accounting.report import Report
from brms.accounting.statement_viewer import HTMLStatementViewer
from brms.models.bank import Bank


bank = Bank()
balances = AccountBalances(
    {
        bank.chart_of_accounts.cash_account: 10_000,
        bank.chart_of_accounts.equity_account: 10_000,
    },
)
bank.initialize(balances)
viewer = HTMLStatementViewer(jupyter=True, hide_zero_balance_accounts=True)

today = datetime.date(2025, 7, 28)
report = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
:::

## Customer deposit

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Now some customers have made some deposits, for example:

- Customer A deposits $60,000.
- Customer B deposits $40,000.
- Customer C deposits $20,000.

Notably, customer deposits are the bank's _liability_. We see an increase in both the bank's total assets and total liabilities, while total shareholders' equity remains unchanged.
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: Some customers have made deposits.
# | panel: center
from brms.instruments.factory import InstrumentFactory
from brms.models.transaction import TransactionFactory, TransactionType

customer_A_deposit = InstrumentFactory.create_deposit(value=60_000)
customer_B_deposit = InstrumentFactory.create_deposit(value=40_000)
customer_C_deposit = InstrumentFactory.create_deposit(value=20_000)
tx_deposit1 = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.DEPOSIT_RECEIVED,
    instrument=customer_A_deposit,
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Customer A's Deposits",
)
tx_deposit2 = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.DEPOSIT_RECEIVED,
    instrument=customer_B_deposit,
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Customer B's Deposits",
)
tx_deposit3 = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.DEPOSIT_RECEIVED,
    instrument=customer_C_deposit,
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Customer C's Deposits",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_deposit1)
bank.process_transaction(tx_deposit2)
bank.process_transaction(tx_deposit3)

report = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
:::

## Deposit withdraw

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Depositors can also withdraw from the bank. 

If Customer C has withdrawn all of their deposits ($20,000), we see a decrease of cash and deposits.
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: Customer C has withdrawn their deposits.
# | panel: center
from brms.models.transaction import DepositWithdrawTransaction

tx_deposit_withdraw = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.DEPOSIT_WITHDRAWAL,
    instrument=customer_C_deposit,
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Customer C withdraw",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_deposit_withdraw)

report = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
:::

## Loan disbursement

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Of course, the typical business of a bank is to make loans. Let's assume the bank has made an (interest-only) loan of $80,000 to some borrowers.
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The bank has made some loans.
# | panel: center
from brms.instruments.base import Instrument
from brms.instruments.mock import MockInstrument
from brms.models.transaction import LoanDisbursementTransaction

(loan := MockInstrument("A loan")).value = 80_000
# fmt: off
tx_loan = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.LOAN_DISBURSEMENT,
    instrument=loan,
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Loan made to a borrower",
)
# fmt: on
bank.process_transaction(tx_loan)

report = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
:::

## Interest paid on deposits

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
After some time (e.g., a month), the bank may need to pay interest on customers' deposits, e.g., $100.

::: {.callout-tip}
__Income Statement__ is included given that we'd like to know the profit and loss (P&L) of the bank over the period.
:::

:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: If the bank has only paid interest on deposits over the month...
# | panel: center
from brms.instruments.cash import Cash
from brms.models.transaction import InterestPaidOnDepositTransaction

today = today + datetime.timedelta(days=31)

tx_interest_paid = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.INTEREST_PAID_ON_DEPOSIT,
    instrument=Cash(value=100),
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Interest paid on deposits",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_interest_paid)

report = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report.print_balance_sheet()
report.print_income_statement()
```
:::
:::

## Loan interest income

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

::: {.callout-note}
If the bank has only paid interest on deposits over this period, it surely has a net loss or negative profit as shown before. 

However, it is more reasonable that the bank also has earned some profits during the same time, especially because it has made some loans.
:::

Suppose that over the 1-month period, the bank has earned some interest income from the loans made earlier, e.g., for a total of $800.

::: {.callout-tip}
Overall, the bank has a net profit of $700. We can observe that the bank's __Retained Earnings__ has increased by $700, too.
:::
:::
::: {.column}

```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: ... if it has also earned interest from loans over the month.
# | panel: center
tx_interest_earned = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.LOAN_INTEREST_PAYMENT,
    instrument=Cash(value=800),
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Interest earned from loans",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_interest_earned)

report = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report.print_balance_sheet()
report.print_income_statement()
```

# Intermediate trading book accounting

## Trading Book

The transactions and non-transactions previous discussed all occur to the bank's __banking book__. 

However, a bank also has a __trading book__ that holds securities for short-term trading P&L purposes. 

::: {.callout-note}
These instruments are named __Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)__.
:::

Accounting for trading book securities is relatively easy. We consider:

1. The purchase
2. The marking-to-market
3. The sale

## FVTPL security purchase

Assume that the bank just purchased a FVTPL security for its trading book at its fair value of $10,000.

The fair value of the security is recorded on the balance sheet under the _Assets at FVTPL_ account.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: Before purchasing some FVTPL securities.
# | panel: center
report1 = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report1.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
::: {.column}

```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The bank has purchased some FVTPL securities.
# | panel: center
from brms.models.base import BookType

fvtpl_security = MockInstrument("A FVTPL Security", BookType.TRADING_BOOK)
fvtpl_security.value = 1_0000
tx_fvtpl_purchase = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.SECURITY_PURCHASE_TRADING,
    instrument=fvtpl_security,
    transaction_date=today,
    description="Purchase a FVTPL security",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_fvtpl_purchase)

report2= Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report2.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
::: 

## FVTPL security marking to market

- The _fair value_ of FVTPL security is __marked to market__ periodically, e.g., daily. 
- This ensures consistency in that they are held for trading P&L in the first place.

There are two possible cases:

1. Unrealized trading loss
2. Unrealized trading gain

::: {.callout-note}
These trading gains and losses are _unrealized_ because the securities have not yet been sold.
:::

## Unrealized trading loss - Income Statement

If the market value of the security went down by 5% ($500) the next day, we need to recognize this _unrealized trading loss_ in the Income Statement.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The Income Statement before.
# | panel: center
report2.print_income_statement()
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The FVTPL security has an unrealized trading loss.
# | panel: center
from brms.instruments.mock import MockValuationVisitor

today = today + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
# Assume that the market value of the FVTPL security went down by 5%
new_fvtpl_instrument_value = fvtpl_security.value * 0.95
valuation_visitor = MockValuationVisitor(new_value=new_fvtpl_instrument_value)
tx_fvtpl_marked_down = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.SECURITY_FVTPL_MARK_TO_MARKET,
    instrument=fvtpl_security,
    transaction_date=today,
    valuation_visitor=valuation_visitor,
    description="Mark to market a FVTPL security (down)",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_fvtpl_marked_down)

report3 = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report3.print_income_statement()
```
:::
:::

## Unrealized trading loss - Balance Sheet

If we were to generate the balance sheet now, such net trading loss would reduce the bank's retained earnings.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The Balance Sheet before.
# | panel: center

report2.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The FVTPL security has an unrealized trading loss.
# | panel: center

report3.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Usually, financial reports are generated at a period's end, such as quarter's end or year's end. What's shown here should be viewed as _what if we close the bank's accounting ledger at this time and generate the reports?_
:::

## Unrealized trading gain - Income Statement

The day after, if the market value of the security went up by 10% ($950), we need to recognize this _unrealized trading gain_.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The Income Statement before.
# | panel: center
report3.print_income_statement()
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The FVTPL security has an unrealized trading gain.
# | panel: center
today = today + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
# Assume that the market value of the FVTPL security went up by 10%
new_fvtpl_instrument_value = fvtpl_security.value * 1.1
valuation_visitor = MockValuationVisitor(new_value=new_fvtpl_instrument_value)
tx_fvtpl_marked_up = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.SECURITY_FVTPL_MARK_TO_MARKET,
    instrument=fvtpl_security,
    transaction_date=today,
    valuation_visitor=valuation_visitor,
    description="Mark to market a FVTPL security (up)",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_fvtpl_marked_up)

report4 = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report4.print_income_statement()
```
:::
:::

## Unrealized trading gain - Balance Sheet

Again, if we were to close the bank's accounting ledger now and check its balance sheet, we will see changes of the bank's retained earnings (increase by $950).

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The Balance Sheet before.
# | panel: center

report3.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The FVTPL security has an unrealized trading gain.
# | panel: center

report4.print_balance_sheet()
```
:::
:::

## FVTPL security sale

The next day, if the bank sold the security at the prevailing market price (assumed 2% up), we recognize _realized trading gain_.

Tracking the P&L of this particular FVTPL security, 

1. On day 1, we had a loss of $500 ($10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500).
2. On day 2, we had a gain of $950 ($9,500 * 1.1 = $10,450).
3. On day 3, we had a gain of $209 ($10,450 * 1.02 = $10,659).

The total P&L from this security is therefore a net gain of $659, which shows up in the Income Statement. 

::: {.callout-note}
Because of the sale, the _unrealized trading gain/loss_ associated with this security must be __reclassified__ to _realized gain/loss_.
:::

## FVTPL security sale - Income Statement

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | code-summary: The Income Statement before.
# | panel: center
report4.print_income_statement()

# | code-summary: The FVTPL security is sold.
# | panel: center
today = today + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
# Assume that the market value of the FVTPL security went up by 2%
new_fvtpl_instrument_value = fvtpl_security.value * 1.02
valuation_visitor = MockValuationVisitor(new_value=new_fvtpl_instrument_value)
tx_fvtpl_marked_up = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.SECURITY_FVTPL_MARK_TO_MARKET,
    instrument=fvtpl_security,
    transaction_date=today,
    valuation_visitor=valuation_visitor,
    description="Mark to market a FVTPL security (up)",
)
bank.process_transaction(tx_fvtpl_marked_up)
# Sale transaction should be created after the previous transaction has been processed
tx_fvtpl_sale = TransactionFactory.create_transaction(
    bank=bank,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.SECURITY_SALE_TRADING,
    instrument=fvtpl_security,
    transaction_date=today,
    valuation_visitor=valuation_visitor,
    description="Sale of FVTPL security (net gain)",

bank.process_transaction(tx_fvtpl_sale)
# fmt: on

report5 = Report(ledger=bank.ledger, viewer=viewer, date=today)
report5.print_income_statement()
# report.print_balance_sheet()
```

- Trading gain: $950 + $209 = $1159
- Trading loss: $500
- Net gain: $659
- Gain/loss _reclassified_ from unrealized to realized
:::

## FVTPL security sale - Balance Sheet

Now, if we were to close the bank's accounting ledger and produce its balance sheet, we will have:

::: {.columns}

:::
:::

## FVTPL security sale - Balance Sheet

Compared to the balance sheet before the bank purchased this FVTPL security, the retained earnings increased by exactly $659.
