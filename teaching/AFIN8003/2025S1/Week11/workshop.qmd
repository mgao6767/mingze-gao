# Exercise

Go to the FDIC website at [https://www.fdic.gov/buying/historical/index.html](https://www.fdic.gov/buying/historical/index.html). From there, click on “Closed Loan Sales,” and then click on “Find” to get information on recent loan sales by banks. What percentage of the current year’s loan sales consisted of performing versus nonperforming loans? Calculate the average percentage loss on these sales.


# Short answer questions

## Q1

An FI is planning the purchase of a $5 million loan to raise the existing average duration of its assets from 3.5 years to 5 years. It currently has total assets worth $20 million, $5 million in cash (0 duration) and $15 million in loans. All the loans are fairly priced.

(a) Assuming it uses the cash to purchase the loan, should it purchase the loan if its duration is seven years?
(b) What asset duration loans should it purchase in order to raise its average duration to five years?

::: {.content-hidden unless-meta="include-answers"}
::: {.callout-tip title="Example answer"}
(a)

    The duration of the existing loan is:
    0 + $15m/$20m(X) = 3.5 years, so existing loan's duration = 4.667 years

    If it purchases $5 million of loans with an average duration of 7 years, its portfolio duration will increase to $5m/$20m(7) +$15m/$20m(4.667) = 5.25 years. In this case, the average duration will be above 5 years. The FI may be better off seeking another loan with a slightly lower duration.

(b) 

    The FI should seek to purchase a loan of duration $D$:

    $5m/$20m(D) + $15m/$20m(4.667 years) = 5 years, so D = 6 years.

## Q2

How does an FI use securitization to manage interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks? Summarize how each of the possible methods of securitization products affects the balance sheet and profitability of an FI in the management of these risks.

::: {.content-hidden unless-meta="include-answers"}
::: {.callout-tip title="Example answer"}
Financial institutions (FIs) use securitisation to manage interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks by converting assets, primarily loans, into securities that can be sold to investors, transferring various risks off their balance sheets.

1. **Interest Rate Risk**: Securitisation allows FIs to remove interest-sensitive assets from their balance sheets, reducing their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. For example:
   - **Pass-through securities** transfer the interest rate risk directly to investors, as payments from underlying borrowers pass through to security holders.
   - **Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)** provide structured risk management by dividing cash flows into tranches with varying levels of protection against prepayment risk, allowing FIs to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes more strategically.

2. **Credit Risk**: By selling loans to a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) or structured investment vehicle (SIV), FIs transfer credit risk to investors who purchase the resulting asset-backed securities (ABS). The loans are now on the balance sheets of the SPV/SIV, isolating the FI from borrower default risk. (On the other hand, loans underlying Mortgage-Backed Bonds (MBBs) remain on the FI’s balance sheet. Excess collateral is used to reduce credit risks for MBB investors.)

3. **Liquidity Risk**: Securitisation enhances liquidity by converting illiquid loans into marketable securities that provide immediate cash inflows. Products like **pass-throughs** and **CMOs** generate funds that can be reinvested or used for other obligations, improving the FI’s ability to meet cash flow needs. The SPV-based model ensures that assets are moved off the FI’s balance sheet, while SIVs manage liquidity by issuing short-term debt (e.g., commercial paper) supported by loan returns.

Balance Sheet and Profitability Impact:

- **Off-Balance-Sheet Treatment**: Pass-through securities and CMOs, transferred to an SPV/SIV, reduce the asset base and free up capital, potentially lowering regulatory capital requirements and improving return on equity.
- **Profitability**: Fee income from originating, structuring, and servicing securitised products boosts non-interest income, while risk reduction in interest rate and credit exposure contributes to more stable profitability. However, MBBs, which remain on the balance sheet, increase collateral requirements and may add to regulatory capital obligations, impacting net profits.
