</section>
<section id="financial-intermediation" class="slide level2">
<h2>Financial intermediation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>financial system</strong> encompasses various <em>financial intermediaries</em>, markets, regulators, and infrastructure in the generation and distribution of financial resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Financial intermediation</strong> is part of the financial system.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the process by which financial intermediaries, such as banks, facilitate the flow of funds between savers and borrowers.</li>
<li>Banks are a major part of financial intermediation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="why-is-banking-and-financial-intermediation-necessary" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why is banking and financial intermediation necessary?</h2>
<p>A banking analogue of the <span class="citation" data-cites="Modigliani1958">Modigliani and Miller (<a href="#/references" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">1958</a>)</span> theorem would imply that banks are useless with perfect financial markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a competitive equilibrium, banks make zero profit and have no impact on other agents’ decisions. Firms are indifferent between bank credit and bonds. <span class="citation" data-cites="freixas_microeconomics_2023">(<a href="#/references" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Freixas and Rochet 2023</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The existence of banks (and other financial intermediaries) must be justified by their roles in <strong>mitigating market frictions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple look at the <span class="citation" data-cites="Diamond1983">Diamond and Dybvig (<a href="#/references" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">1983</a>)</span> model.</li>
<li>The optimal allocation can be achieved with competitive banks offering deposit contracts and investing in the long-term (i.e., maturity transformation).
<ul>
<li>also, asset transformation, risk transformation and liquidity transformation.</li>
<li>Panic-based bank runs may occur even when illiquid assets are risk-free.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Banks are also better positioned to mitigate informational frictions in the market due to <strong>economies of scale</strong>.

<h1>Risks and regulation</h1>

</section>
<section id="banking-regulations" class="slide level2">
<h2>Banking regulations</h2>
<p>Failure of banks has significant negative externality. As a result, banks are heavily regulated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of deposits for savers</li>
<li>No credit supply for borrowers</li>
<li>Impact on real economy</li>
<li>Global Financial Crisis (GFC) 2007-2009</li>
</ul>
<p>Broadly, banking regulations can be classified into two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microprudential regulations</strong>: safety and soundness of individual institutions</li>
<li><strong>Macroprudential regulations</strong>: stability of the financial system</li>
</ul>
<p>The two aspects are not mutually exclusive, but complementary.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-banking-regulatory-landscape" class="slide level2">
<h2>The banking regulatory landscape</h2>
<p>Before GFC, the banking regulations primarily focused on prudential regulations concerning the risks of individual banks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital adequacy</strong>: sufficient capital to cover potential losses.</li>
<li><strong>Risk management</strong>: ability to manage various risks such as credit, market, and operational risks.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity management</strong>: enough liquid resources to meet immediate obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-GFC, the banking regulations have <em>expanded</em> to include macroprudential regulations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic focus</strong>: greater emphasis on understanding and mitigating systemic risks that could destabilize the entire financial system.</li>
<li><strong>Countercyclical policies</strong>: measures introduced to mitigate the procyclical effects of previous regulatory approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Stress testing</strong>: system-wide tests to assess the resilience of the financial system to shocks.</li>
</ul>

<section id="bank-risks---our-approach" class="slide level2">
<h2>Bank risks - our approach</h2>
<p>In this course, we examine bank risks one by one in a three-step framework:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Identify</strong>: definition, source and nature</li>
<li><strong>Measure</strong>: ways to gauge the exposure</li>
<li><strong>Manage</strong>: strategies to mitigate</li>

<h1>Capital management and adequacy</h1>

</section>
<section id="capital-management-and-regulation" class="slide level2">
<h2>Capital management and regulation</h2>
<p>In summary,</p>
<ul>
<li>capital is useful to absorb losses and to mitigate insolvency risk;</li>
<li>regulators determine the <em>adequate</em> capital requirements for FIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, FI’s capital is guided by two key factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>regulated capital adequacy requirements, and</li>
<li>the risk-return trade-offs.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="who-determines-the-capital-requirements" class="slide level2">
<h2>Who determines the capital requirements?</h2>
<p>Actual capital ratios applied can be country-specific, determined by national regulators. However, the <strong>Basel Accords</strong> provide the global framework for these capital ratios.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) of the BIS sets out the 1988 Basel Capital Accord.</li>
<li>Member countries of the BIS agreed and implemented the Basel Capital Accord (<strong>Basel I</strong>).</li>
<li>A series of updates led to the Basel Accord of 2006 (<strong>Basel II</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Basel III</strong>: responding to the 2007-09 financial crisis.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="basel-i" class="slide level2">
<h2>Basel I</h2>
<p>Two capital ratios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Tier 1 Capital Ratio</strong>
<ul>
<li>Primarily composed of common equity, retained earnings, and disclosed reserves, less goodwill and other intangibles.</li>
<li>Calculation: Tier 1 Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)</li>
<li>Minimum requirement: 4%</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Total Capital Ratio</strong>
<ul>
<li>Minimum requirement: 8%</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basel I introduced the systematic measurement of capital adequacy through the use of risk-weighted assets.</li>
<li>Basel I utilized RWA to account for the varying risk levels of different asset classes, including both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet exposures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Criticisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit Risk Focus</strong>: Basel I primarily recognized credit risk in the calculation of risk-weighted assets. It did not initially incorporate market risk or operational risk, leading to criticisms that it did not fully address the spectrum of risks faced by banks.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<aside><ol class="aside-footnotes"><li id="fn1"><p>A revision in 1998 incorporated market risk into the framework.</p></li></ol></aside></section>
<section id="basel-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2>Basel II</h2>
<p>Basel II comprised three pillars:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>minimum capital requirements</strong>, which sought to develop and expand the standardised rules set out in the 1988 Accord</li>
<li><strong>supervisory review</strong> of an institution’s capital adequacy and internal assessment process</li>
<li><strong>effective use of disclosure</strong> as a lever to strengthen market discipline and encourage sound banking practices</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The measurement of capital did not change markedly in Basel II.</li>
<li>The measurement of risk was significantly enhanced to include operational risk, some market risks in the banking book, and risks associated with securitisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Basel II, two options are allowed for banks to measure their credit risk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Standardized approach</strong>. Similar to Basel I, but more risk-sensitive.</li>
<li><strong>Internal ratings-based (IRB) approach</strong>. Banks can use their internal rating system or credit scoring models to assess their portfolios, subject to regulatory approval.</li>
</ol>
<p>Three options are available for measuring operational risk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>basic indicator.</li>
<li>standardized approach.</li>
<li>advanced measurement approach.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="gfc-and-basel-2.5" class="slide level2">
<h2>GFC and Basel 2.5</h2>
<p>The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2007-09 revealed that Basel II was flawed. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>credit ratings of complex securities were conducted by private companies without regulatory supervision or review</li>
<li>Basel II capital adequacy formula was procyclical, meaning that the required capital was increasing as the crisis unfolded, making it even harder for banks during crisis</li>
</ul>
<p>In response, Basel 2.5 was passed in 2009 (effective in 2013) and Basel III was passed in 2010 (phased in between 2013 and 2019).<sup>1</sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Basel 2.5 updated capital requirements on market risk from banks’ trading activities.</li>
</ul>
<aside><ol class="aside-footnotes"><li id="fn2"><p>Basel III framework was revised and finalized in 2017 and the implementation was extended to January 1, 2022.</p></li></ol></aside></section>
<section id="basel-iii" class="slide level2">
<h2>Basel III</h2>
<p>Basel III is broader in perspective than just a revision of capital, capital adequacy, risk measurement and supervision. It introduced <strong>macroprudential</strong> measures, targeting the protection of the whole financial system.</p>
<p>Three pillars similar to in Basel II, but with significant enhancements.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Improvements to both standardized and IRB approaches in calculating adequate capital.</li>
<li>Inclusion of new <strong>capital conversion buffer</strong> and <strong>countercyclical capital buffer</strong> to the minimum required capital level.</li>
<li>Introduction of two minimum standards for funding liquidity: <strong>liquidity coverage ratio</strong> and <strong>net stable funding ratio</strong>.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Higher capital requirements for trading and derivative activities.</li>
<li>Enhanced bank governance.</li>
<li>Enhanced risk disclosure.</li>

<p>One of the key functions performed by financial institutions (especially depositary institutions) is <strong>maturity transformation</strong>. For DIs, they take short-term deposits from depositors and make long-term loans to borrowers. As a result,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This maturity transformation means that FIs have <strong>mismatches of maturities</strong> of their liabilities (e.g., deposits) and assets (e.g., loans).</li>
<li>Maturity mismatch exposes FIs to (unexpected) interest rate changes:
<ol type="1">
<li>refinancing and reinvestment risks</li>
<li>financial instruments have different levels of value sensitivity to interest rate changes</li>

<h2>Interest rate risk and Basel framework</h2>
<p>As discussed previously, the three pillars of Basel framework (since Basel II) include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>minimum capital requirements</li>
<li>supervisory review</li>
<li>effective use of disclosure (for market discipline)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pillar 1 involves a capital adequacy framework surrounding minimum ratios of various capital (CET1, Tier 1, Total) to RWA.</p>
<ul>
<li>The RWA is sum of RWAs for credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.</li>
<li>There is currently no “RWA for interest rate risk”.</li>

<h2>Repricing gap, RSA and RSL</h2>
<p><strong>Repricing gap</strong> is the difference between rate-sensitive assets (<strong>RSA</strong>) and rate-sensitive liabilities (<strong>RSL</strong>).</p>

<li>RSL: liabilities whose interest rates will be repriced or changed over some future period (rate-sensitive liabilities)</li>

<p>An asset (or liability) is “rate-sensitive” if it is repriced at or near current market interest rates within a certain time horizon (or maturity bucket). For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>variable-rate</em> mortgage’s interest rate may be reset every quarter based on the prevailing interest rate.</li>

<p><strong>Market Risk</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p><strong>Market risk</strong> is uncertainty of an FI’s earnings on its trading portfolio caused by changes, particularly extreme changes, in market conditions such as the price of an asset, interest rates, market volatility, and market liquidity.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>FIs are concerned about the potential impact of changing market conditions on their trading book and ultimately their net worth and solvency.</p>
<p>A natural question becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to quantify such impact? What is the <strong>potential change in value</strong> of trading portfolio for a given period?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More specifically,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is the worst loss we can expect not to exceed with a given confidence level over a specific time horizon?</li>
<li>What is the expected loss when losses exceed a certain level over a specific time horizon?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answering these questions leads to the development of two important concepts for measuring market risk exposure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Value at Risk (VaR).</li>
<li>Expected Shortfall (ES).</li>
</ol>
<p>We start with the concept of Value at Risk (VaR), then discuss its limitations and the use of Expected Shortfall (ES).</p>
</section>
<section id="value-at-risk-var" class="slide level2">
<h2>Value at Risk (VaR)</h2>
<p>Suppose we know the distribution of an asset’s returns over a specific period (in the future), then for a given confidence level <span class="math inline">\(c\in[0,1]\)</span> (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(c=0.95\)</span>), we can partition the distribution into two parts: one (in red) that represents a proportion of <span class="math inline">\((1-c)\)</span> of the distribution and the other (in blue) accounting the remaining <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> proportion.</p>

<section id="models-for-computing-var" class="slide level2">
<h2>Models for computing VaR</h2>
<p>Over the years, many models have been developed to compute VaR.</p>
<p>This is because we do not have the return distribution of trading portfolio over a specific period in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we do, then VaR is unambiguous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, different assumptions lead to different models and approaches. We are interested in three in this course:</p>

<li>Historic or back simulation</li>
<li>Monte Carlo simulation</li>
</ol>

<section id="expected-shortfall-es" class="slide level2">
<h2>Expected Shortfall (ES)</h2>
<p>The drawbacks of VaR became painfully evident during the financial crisis as asset returns plummeted into the fat-tail region of non-normally shaped distributions.</p>
<p>FI managers and regulators were forced to recognize that VaR projections of possible losses far underestimated actual losses on extreme bad days.</p>
<p>Now, regulators have replaced VaR with the <strong>expected shortfall (ES)</strong> measure as the main measure of market risk.</p>
<p>Expected shortfall, aka “conditional VaR”, estimates the expected value of losses beyond a given confidence level—that is, it is the average of VaRs beyond a given confidence level.</p>
</section>
<section id="es-definition" class="slide level2">

\]</span></p>
<p>That is, for a confidence level of, say, 95% (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>), we measure the area under the probability distribution from the 95th to 100th percentile.</p>

<h2>ES: advantages and (potential) problems</h2>
<p>ES is the average of losses that occur beyond the VaR level. It provides a better risk assessment by considering the tail of the loss distribution.</p>
<p>In addition, an important advantage of ES over VaR is that ES is additive.</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that the ES of a portfolio equals the sum of individual assets’ ESs.</li>

<h2>Calculating the return on a loan</h2>
<p>Once the decision to make a loan has been made, the pricing of the loan is an important aspect of credit risk management, which includes adjustments for the perceived credit risk of the borrower as well as any fees and collateral backing the loan.</p>
<p>A traditional <strong>return on assets approach</strong> to calculate the return on a loan is explained here.</p>

<h2>The cash market and Exchange Settlement Account (ESA)</h2>
<p>The <strong>cash market</strong> is where banks lend and borrow funds from each other, typically on an overnight basis. These funds can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet liquidity needs: Banks may borrow funds to ensure they meet short-term liquidity requirements, such as the ESA balances.</li>
<li>Support lending activities: Banks may also use borrowed funds to support ongoing lending activities.</li>
<li>Facilitate settlement of transactions: The funds can help banks settle large-scale interbank transactions efficiently.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <em>price</em> of funds in this market is the interest rate on these interbank loans, which is called the <strong>cash rate</strong> in Australia.</li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>A repo is a transaction with two parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first part, the Reserve Bank could lend ES balances to a bank and receive a bond in exchange. This increases the supply of ES balances available to banks.</li>
<li>In the pre-arranged second part, the transaction is reversed. The Reserve Bank returns the bond and receives back the ES balances, which decreases the supply of ES balances.</li>

<p>After the introduction of the package of policy measures in response to the COVID-19 recession,</p>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-new-dynamics" class="slide level2">
<h2>The new dynamics</h2>
<p>Since COVID-19, the RBA significantly adjusted its monetary operations, moving away from repos as the primary tool for managing liquidity. Banks now manage their ESA balances primarily through other mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/mkt-operations/term-funding-facility/">Term Funding Facility (ended 30 June 2024)</a>: Introduced during the pandemic, the TFF allowed banks to access longer-term funding at very low rates. It helped banks manage funding needs over the pandemic period.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/mkt-operations/government-bond-purchases.html">Government Bond Purchases (ceased on 10 February 2022)</a>: The RBA engaged in large-scale government bond purchases to inject liquidity into the financial system. This action increased the level of reserves in the banking system, reducing the immediate need for repo operations.</li>
<li>Standing Facility: Banks can still access liquidity via the RBA’s standing liquidity facility, where they can borrow overnight at a penalty rate if their ESA balances fall short.</li>
<li>Interbank Cash Market: Banks continue to borrow and lend among themselves in the interbank cash market to manage daily fluctuations in their ESA balances.</li>
<li>Repo Transactions in the Private Market. While the RBA no longer conducts open market repos, banks and other financial institutions still use repo transactions with each other as a way to manage liquidity and secure short-term funding. These private market repos are similar in structure to the RBA’s past operations but are conducted bilaterally between financial institutions.</li>

<li>We now explore how inflation in one country affects its foreign currency exchange rates, focusing on <strong>purchasing power parity (PPP)</strong>.</li>

<h2>Purchasing Power Parity</h2>
<p>Nominal interest rate <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is basically the sum of inflation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and real interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>:</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>When inflation rates and/or interest rates change, foreign exchange rates (without government control) should adjust to account for relative differences in the price levels (inflation) between the two countries.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is one theory explaining how this adjustment takes place.</p>
</section>
<section id="purchasing-power-parity-contd" class="slide level2">
<h2>Purchasing Power Parity (cont’d)</h2>
<p>Let’s think of an example to illustrate the idea of PPP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you have $1 and can buy one candy in the U.S. Now, let’s say in Japan, 100 yen also buys one candy.</li>
<li><strong>If $1 is worth 100 yen</strong>, things are “balanced”.</li>
<li>But if candy’s price in Japan increases to 150 yen (inflation in Japan), your $1 won’t buy as much candy anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>PPP states that, in different countries, the same money should buy the same amount of goods and services. So, when prices change, the money’s value changes, too, to keep things fair.</p>
<ul>
<li>The relative value of money is the exchange rate!</li>

</div>
<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The PPP says that the most important factor determining exchange rates is the price differences drive trade flows and thus demand for and supplies of currencies.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Specifically, the PPP theorem states that the change in the exchange rate between two countries’ currencies is proportional to the difference in the inflation rates in the two countries. That is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
i_{domestic} - i_{foreign} = \frac{\Delta S_{domestic/foreign}}{S_{domestic/foreign}}
\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(S_{domestic/foreign}\)</span> is the spot exchange rate of the domestic currency for the foreign currency</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{domestic/foreign}\)</span> is the change in the one-period spot exchange rate</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="purchasing-power-parity-contd-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Purchasing Power Parity (cont’d)</h2>
<p>Suppose that the current spot exchange rate of Australian dollars for Chinese yuan, <span class="math inline">\(S_{AUD/CNY}\)</span>, is 0.17 (i.e.&nbsp;0.17 dollars, or 17 cents is equal to 1 yuan). The price of Chinese-produced goods increases by 10 per cent (i.e.&nbsp;inflation in China <span class="math inline">\(i_C\)</span>, is 10 per cent), and the Australian price index increases by 4 per cent (i.e.&nbsp;inflation in Australia, <span class="math inline">\(i_{AUS}\)</span>, is 4 per cent). What will be the change of the exchange rate?</p>
<p>According to PPP:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
i_{AUS} - i_{C} = \frac{\Delta S_{AUD/CNY}}{S_{AUD/CNY}}
\]</span></p>
<p>So that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
0.04 - 0.1 = \frac{\Delta S_{AUD/CNY}}{0.17}
\]</span></p>
<p>Solving the equation, we get <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{AUD/CNY} = −0.0102\)</span>. Thus, it costs 1.02 cents less to receive a yuan. The Chinese yuan depreciates in value by 6 per cent against the Australian dollar as a result of its higher relative inflation rate. In other words, a 6 per cent fall in the yuan’s value translates into a new exchange rate of 0.1598 dollars per yuan.</p>
</section>
<section id="purchasing-power-parity-contd-3" class="slide level2">
<h2>Purchasing Power Parity (cont’d)</h2>
<p>The theory behind purchasing power parity is the <strong>law of one price</strong>, an economic concept which states that in an efficient market, if countries produce a good or service that is identical to that in other countries, that good or service must have a single price, no matter where it is purchased.</p>
</section>
<section id="interest-rate-parity" class="slide level2">
<h2>Interest Rate Parity</h2>
<p>To illustrate (covered) <strong>interest rate parity (IRP)</strong>, let’s consider two investment strategies.</p>
<p>Strategy 1: Domestic Investment</p>
<ul>
<li>You invest $1 domestically at an interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r_d\)</span> for one period.</li>
<li>After one period, your investment grows to <span class="math inline">\(1 + r_d\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2: Foreign Investment with Forward Contract</p>
<ul>
<li>You convert $1 into foreign currency at the current spot exchange rate <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, which gives <span class="math inline">\(1/S\)</span> foreign currency.</li>
<li>You then invest the foreign currency amount in a foreign asset at the interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> for one period.</li>
<li>After one period, this investment grows to <span class="math inline">\((1 + r_f)\)</span>.</li>
<li>You lock in the forward exchange rate <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> now to convert the foreign currency back to domestic currency after one period.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these two strategies to have the same return (and eliminate arbitrage opportunities), the returns on both should be equivalent when the foreign investment is converted back using the forward rate. This gives us the CIRP condition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
1 + r_d = \frac{(1 + r_f) \cdot F}{S}
\]</span></p>
<p>Rearranging, we can see the relation between interest rates and the forward rate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
F = S \cdot \frac{1 + r_d}{1 + r_f}
\]</span></p>
