# Exercise 

The following table provides the data on LCR and NSFR of the "Big 4" Australian banks for FR2023. It shows that NAB has the highest LCR of 140%. 

Let's focus on NAB and conduct some exercise!

|                                      |     CBA |     NAB |     ANZ | Westpac |
|--------------------------------------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| __Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)__   |         |         |         |         |
| Average High Quality Liquid   Assets | 189,419 | 209,561 | 267,905 | 181,882 |
| Average Net Cash Outflows            | 144,657 | 149,665 | 201,528 | 136,200 |
| Average Liquidity Coverage   Ratio   |  131.00 |  140.00 |  132.90 |  134.00 |
| __Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)__  |         |         |         |         |
| Available Stable Funding             | 860,999 | 646,508 | 625,285 | 707,893 |
| Required Stable Funding              | 693,453 | 556,016 | 537,430 | 615,341 |
| Net Stable Funding Ratio             |  124.00 |  116.00 |  116.35 |  115.00 |

__Instructions__

1. Locate and download the most recent "Pillar 3" full-year report of NAB. It should be the __Full Year Pillar 3 Report__ for 2024. You can start with [NAB's regulatory disclosures](https://www.nab.com.au/about-us/shareholder-centre/regulatory-disclosures).
2. Read and examine the section on __Liquidity Coverage Ratio__.
3. Conduct research and try to answer the following questions.

__Questions__

1. What is the average LCR of NAB for the 3 months ended 30 September, 2024? Compared to the previous period (3 months ended 30 June, 2024), is LCR higher or lower?

::: {.content-hidden unless-meta="include-answers"}
::: {.callout-tip title="Example answer"}
137%. Same as its previous value.
:::
:::

2. What is the reason for the observed change/nonchange in LCR?

::: {.content-hidden unless-meta="include-answers"}
::: {.callout-tip title="Example answer"}
Average LCR for the three months ended 30 September 2024 remained unchanged at 137%, with a \$6.8 billion increase in average liquid assets, and a \$5.4 billion increase in average net cash outflows.
The increase in average liquid assets was mainly a result of higher HQLA, partially offset by lower RBNZ (Reserve Bank of New Zealand) securities.
The increase in average net cash outflows was largely due to modelling changes in derivative collateral requirements and higher cash outflows from wholesale deposits and unsecured wholesale funding in the 30-day stress period, partially offset by a decrease in cash outflows from secured wholesale funding related to repayment of the final tranches of the TFF in the prior quarter.
:::
:::

3. What is the largest component of cash inflows?

::: {.content-hidden unless-meta="include-answers"}
::: {.callout-tip title="Example answer"}
Cash inflows from secured lending, which represent expected cash inflows that a bank anticipates receiving from lending activities where the loans are backed by collateral.

These secured lending inflows are considered more reliable because the presence of collateral reduces the risk of loss, making these inflows an important part of a bank’s liquidity planning and Pillar 3 disclosures.
:::
:::

4. Why is the HQLA reported as an "average"? How many data points were used to compute such average? Provide reference to the relevant prudential standard in Australia.

::: {.content-hidden unless-meta="include-answers"}
::: {.callout-tip title="Example answer"}
APS 330 Public Disclosure provides a template for liquidity disclosures. See for example Attachment F of [Final APS 330](https://www.apra.gov.au/public-disclosure-requirements-for-authorised-deposit-taking-institutions).

Based on the guidelines, data is calculated based on a simple average of daily LCR outcomes, excluding non-business days. There were 66 daily
LCR data points used in calculating the average for the current quarter and 62 in the previous quarter.
