# Liquidity Risk

## Introduction

Liquidity risk is a normal aspect of everyday management of a financial institution (FI).

- Depository institutions (DIs) are more exposed to liquidity risk than others
- In extreme cases liquidity risk can threaten the solvency of an FI
- The Global Financial Crisis commencing in 2008 was, in part, due to liquidity risk
- Liquidity risk may result from asset side or liability side

We focus on the risk exposure of DIs.

## Causes of liquidity risk

Liquidity risk can arise on both sides of the balance sheet: the asset side as well as the liability side

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
- Liability side
    - Depositors and other claim holders decide to cash in their financial claims immediately
        - The DI has to borrow additional funds or sell assets
    - DI need to be able to predict the distribution of __net deposit drains__
        - The difference between deposit withdrawals and deposit additions on any specific normal banking day
::::
:::: {.column}
- Asset side
    - Risk from OBS loan commitments and other credit lines
    - Change of the value of investment securities portfolios due to unexpected changes of interest rates
    - Problems associated with 'quick' asset sales/fire-sales
        - High costs for turning illiquid assets into cash
        - Low sales price; in worst case, fire-sale price

# Liquidity risk at depository institutions

## Liability-side liquidity risk

- A DI’s balance sheet typically features a large amount of short-term liabilities funding relatively long-term assets.
    - Short-term liabilities: demand deposits, other transaction accounts, etc.
    - Long-term assets: mortgages, C&I loans, etc.
- Demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts (MMDAs), and other transaction accounts allow holders to demand immediate repayment of the face value in cash.
    - For example, a DI with 20% of its liabilities in demand deposits, MMDAs, and other transaction accounts must be ready to liquidate assets to cover that amount on any banking day.


::: {.callout-note}
As of June 2021, U.S. commercial banks had total deposits representing 82.19% of total liabilities and capital.

- Cash assets accounted for only 15.45% of total assets.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
## Liability-side liquidity risk (cont'd)

For CBA, cash and liquid assets account for 9.3% of total assets.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
## Liability-side liquidity risk (cont'd)
:::

For CBA, deposits and other public borrowings account for 73.25% of total liabilities.

::: {.callout-tip title="It's not that bad."}
- Normally, only a small proportion of its deposits will be withdrawn on any given day.
- Further, deposit withdrawals may in part be offset by the inflow of new deposits[^problem-inflow] (and the DI's income). 
:::

[^problem-inflow]: Large inflow of deposits may also cause issues if the DI cannot find sufficiently attractive investments.

Most demand deposits are relatively "stable", acting as consumer __core deposits__ on a daily basis.

- __Core deposits__ are those deposits that provide a DI with a long-term funding source.

The DI manager must monitor and predict the _net deposit drains_ on any given normal banking day.

- Beyond predictable daily seasonality in deposit flows, other seasonal variations exist.
- Many of these seasonal variations are somewhat predictable.
- Retail DIs often experience above-average deposit outflows around the end of the year and in the summer (due to Christmas and the vacation season).
- Rural DIs may experience a deposit inflow–outflow cycle aligned with the local agricultural cycle.
    - During the planting and growing season, deposits tend to fall.
    - During the harvest season, deposits tend to rise as crops are sold.

## Net deposit drains

# | fig-location: center
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data for the plot
x = np.linspace(-10, 15, 1000)
y = np.exp(-0.5 * ((x - 5) / 4)**2) / (4 * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))

```
::::
:::: {.column}
Consider a probability distribution of net deposit drains that is assumed to be strongly peaked at the 5 percent net deposit withdrawal level, as shown in @fig-net-deposit-drains-positive.

- This DI expects approximately 5 percent of its net deposit funds to be withdrawn on any given day with the highest probability.
- A _positive_ net drain on deposits, so its new deposit funds and other cash flows are expected to be insufficient to offset deposit withdrawals.

As a result, the liability side of the DI's balance sheet is __contracting__.

::::
:::: {.column}
Consider another probability distribution of net deposit drains that is assumed to be strongly peaked at the -2 percent net deposit withdrawal level, as shown in @fig-net-deposit-drains-negative.

- A _negative_ net drain on deposits, so its new deposit funds and other cash flows are expected to be larger than deposit withdrawals.

As a result, this DI is expected to grow with an __expanding__ balance sheet.

## Managing net deposit drains

Generally a drain on deposits at DIs can be managed by

- purchased liquidity management
- stored liquidity management

Traditionally, DIs have relied on stored liquidity management. Today, most DIs rely on purchased liquidity management.

::: {.callout-note}
We will discuss in greater detail liquidity management in next week.
:::

## Purchased liquidity management

- A DI manager seeking to _purchase liquidity_ turns to markets for purchased funds.
- Options include the cash market and the repurchase agreement markets, which are interbank markets for short-term loans.
- Alternatively, the DI manager could:
  - Issue additional wholesale certificates of deposit.
  - Sell notes and bonds.
- Borrowed funds (at market rates) are likely to be at higher rates than interest paid on deposits.

::::
:::: {.column width="30%"}
- Purchased liquidity management allows DIs to maintain their overall balance sheet size
- A liability-side adjustment to the balance sheet to cover a deposit drain
::::
:::

## Stored liquidity management

- A DI manager could also _liquidate_ some of its assets, utilizing its stored liquidity.

- Traditionally, U.S. DIs hold cash reserves at the Federal Reserve and in their vaults to meet liquidity needs.
- The Federal Reserve sets minimum reserve requirements for banks' cash reserves.
- Despite these requirements, DIs often hold cash reserves above the minimum to manage liquidity drains.

::: {.callout-note}
- In U.S., the Fed reduced the reserve requirement to 0, effective March 26, 2020.
- In Australia, the RBA does not impose formal reserve requirements.

::::
:::: {.column width="40%"}
- Size of balance sheet decreases
- DIs tend to prudently hold low-rate excess reserve assets to meet liquidity drains
::::

## Asset-side liquidity risk

This far we have discussed the liability-side liquidity risk due to net deposit drains.

On the asset side, liquidity problems can arise due to 

- loan requests 
- the exercise by borrowers of their loan commitments and other credit lines! (e.g., at the onset of COVID-19)

See for example @acharya_why_2024.

## Asset-side liquidity risk (investment portfolio)

Another type of asset-side liquidity risk arises from the investment portfolio.

- Rising interest rates reduce the value of investment portfolios.
- Liquidity in a particular market could deteriorate because no one wants to buy.

Technological development is claimed to have improved the liquidity of financial markets. But given the __herding__ hebaviour in the market, liquidity could still dry up and investment securities only sold at fire-sale prices.

- The FI must fund the loss in value on the balance sheet such that loan requests and deposit withdrawals can be met.
- The result is increased liquidity risk for the FI.

## Measuring a DI's liquidity risk exposure

1. Financing gap and the financing requirement.

- __Financing gap__ is the difference between a DI's average loans and average (core) deposits:

$$
\text{Financing gap} = \text{Average loans} - \text{Average deposits}
$$

A positive financing gap implies that the DI must fund it using its cash and liquid assets and/or borrowing funds in the money market. Therefore,

$$
\text{Financing gap} = -\text{Liquid assets} + \text{Borrowerd funds}
$$

We thus have the following relationship:

$$
\text{Financing gap} + \text{Liquid assets} = \text{Financing requirement (borrowed funds)}
$$

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
## Measuring a DI's liquidity risk exposure (cont'd)

2. Peer group ratio comparison

Comparison of certain key ratios and balance sheet features of the DI with similar DIs, for example,

- Loans to deposits
- Loans to assets
- Core deposits to total assets
- (Unused) loan commitments to assets

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
## Measuring a DI's liquidity risk exposure (cont'd)
:::

3. Liquidity index

Developed by Jim Pierce at the Federal Reserve, __liquidity index__ measures the potential losses an FI could suffer from a sudden or fire-sale disposal of assets compared with the amount it would receive at a fair market value established under normal market (sale) conditions.

$$
I = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(W_i \times \frac{P_i}{P^*_i}\right)
$$

where

- $W_i$ is the percentage of each asset in the FI's portfolio
- $P_i$ is the immediate sale price
- $P^*_i$ is the fair market price

The liquidity index should lie between 0 and 1.

## Liquidity risk measures

- During the financial crisis, many DIs struggled to maintain adequate liquidity.
- Central banks had to provide extraordinary levels of liquidity assistance to sustain the financial system.
- Despite this support, some DIs failed or were forced into mergers.
- In response, the BIS's Basel Committee on Banking Supervision introduced two new regulatory standards for liquidity risk supervision:
  - **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):**
    - Came into effect on January 1, 2015.
    - Gradually implemented, reaching full compliance on January 1, 2019.
  - **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):**
    - Became a minimum standard on January 1, 2018.
- These rules apply to:
  - Large, internationally active banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets.
  - Organizations with $10 billion or more in total on-balance-sheet foreign exposure.
  - Consolidated subsidiary depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total assets.

## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

- The __Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)__ is designed to ensure that a DI maintains sufficient __high-quality liquid assets (HQLA)__.
- These HQLA must be easily convertible to cash to meet liquidity needs over a 30-day period.
- The LCR is based on an "acute liquidity stress scenario" defined by supervisors.
  - The scenario includes both institution-specific and systemic shocks.
  - It reflects actual conditions experienced during the global financial crisis.
- The purpose of maintaining the LCR is to ensure that DIs can survive severe liquidity stress for at least 30 days.
- The LCR is reported to DI supervisors on a monthly basis.

$$
\text{Minimum LCR} = \frac{\text{Stock of HQLAs}}{\text{Total net cash outflows over next 30 calendar days}} \ge 100\%
$$

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) (cont'd)
:::

The stock of HQLAs is defined as follows:

- Liquid assets in the stock must remain liquid in times of stress (i.e., convertible into cash at little loss of value and can be used at the central bank discount window as collateral).
- Liquid assets in the stock must be “unencumbered”, i.e., free of legal, regulatory, contractual, or other restrictions on the ability of the bank to liquidate, sell, transfer, or assign the asset.
- Liquid assets in the stock are divided into level 1 and level 2. Level 1 amount has no cap, and level 2 amount is capped at 40 percent of the stock.
    - Level 1 assets are limited to:
        - Cash, central bank reserves, marketable securities representing claims on or guaranteed by sovereigns, central banks, public sector entities (PSE), and some supranational institutions (e.g., BIS, IMF, ECB, multilateral development banks).[^more-restrictions]
    - Level 2A assets (15% haircut): 
        - Eligible marketable securities representing claims on or guaranteed by sovereigns, central banks, PSEs, or multilateral development banks.
        - Eligible corporate debt securities and covered bonds.
    - Level 2B assets: 
        - Eligible residential mortgage backed securities (25% haircut).
        - Eligible corporate debt securities and equities (50% haircut).

[^more-restrictions]: There're more restrictions.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) (cont'd)
:::

The total net cash outflows is defined as:

<!-- $$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Total net cash outflows over next 30 calendar days} &= \text{Total expected cash outflows} \\
&- \min(\text{Total expected cash inflows}, 75\% \text{ of total expected cash outflows})
\end{aligned}
$$ -->
$$
\text{Total net cash outflows over next 30 calendar days} = Out - \min(In, 75\% \times Out)
$$

where

- $Out$ is total expected cash outflows
- $In$ is total expected cash inflows

Cash inflows and outflows are computed based on the type of assets/liabilities and associated draw-down factors.

::: {.callout-note}
For a detailed calculation of cash outflows and inflows, refer to textbook @saunders_financial_2023 or to the suggested readings.
:::

## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): example

Consider the following balance sheet (in million of dollars) of a bank. Calculate the bank's LCR.

- Assume that the cash inflows over the next 30 days from the bank's assets are $5 million.

| **Assets**                    | \$  | **Liquidity Level** | **Liabilities and Equity**            | \$  | **Run-Off Factor** |

## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): example (cont'd)
:::

The LCR is calculated as follows:

First, calculate the amount of HQLA.

- Level 1 assets is $5+15+100=120$ million

Before adjustment for capps,

- Level 2A assets is $(75+110)\times (1-15\%) = 157.25$ million[^l2a-haircut]
- Level 2B assets is $85\times (1-50\%)=42.5$ million[^l2b-haircut]

However, Level 2 assets is capped at 40% of HQLA!

- Given that Level 1 assets is 120 million, which should account for at least $1-40\%=60\%$ of HQLA.
- HQLA should be $120/(1-40\%) = 200$ million, which means a maximum of $200-120=80$ million Level 2 assets.
- The Level 2 assets after haircut is larger than the cap - they will not further increase HQLA.

Therefore, the HQLA is 200 million.

[^l2a-haircut]: There is a 15% haircut applied on the value of Level 2A assets.
[^l2b-haircut]: There is a 50% haircut applied on the value of Level 2B assets.

## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): example (cont'd)
:::

Next, calculate the total net cash outflows over next 30 days.

Cash outflows are:

- Stable retail deposits: $95\times 0.03 = 2.85$
- Less stable retail deposits: $40\times 0.1 = 4$
- Stable small business deposits: $100\times 0.05 = 5$
- Less stable small business deposits: $80\times 0.1 =8$
- Nonfinancial corporates: $50\times 0.75 = 37.5$

Therefore,

- Total cash outflows over next 30 days is 57.35 million.
- Total cash inflows over next 30 days is 5 million (assumed).
- Total net cash outflows over next 30 days is 52.35 million.

Lastly, calculate LCR:

$$
\text{LCR} = \frac{\text{Stock of HQLAs}}{\text{Total net cash outflows over next 30 calendar days}} = \frac{200}{52.35} = 382.04\% \ge 100\%
$$

## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

- The __Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)__ focuses on long-term liquidity management on a DI’s balance sheet.
- It evaluates liquidity across the entire balance sheet, encouraging the use of stable sources of financing.
- The NSFR requires a minimum amount of stable funding over a one-year time horizon.
    - It aims to limit the reliance on short-term wholesale funding, a significant issue during the financial crisis.
- The NSFR has been reported to DI supervisors quarterly since 2018.

$$
\text{NSFR} = \frac{\text{Available amount of stable funding}}{\text{Required amount of stable funding}} \ge 100\%
$$

## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

Available stable funding (ASF) includes:

- Bank capital
- Preferred stock with a maturity > 1 year
- Liabilities with maturities > 1 year
- The portion of retail deposits and wholesale deposit expected to stay with bank during a period of idiosyncratic stress

These equity and liabilities are assigned to one of five categories, each with a specific ASF factor.

ASF is calculated as the sum of the weighted amounts.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
:::

Required stable funding (RSF) is calculated as the sum of 

1. the value of the on-balance-sheet assets multiplied by a specific RSF factor assigned to each particular asset type, and
2. the amount of off-balance-sheet (OBS) activities (or potential liquidity exposure) multiplied by the associated RSF factor.

## Liquidity planning

- **Liquidity planning** is crucial for managing liquidity risk and costs, helping with borrowing priorities and minimizing excess reserves.
- Components of a liquidity plan:
  1. Managerial responsibilities: Assign roles during a liquidity crisis and manage public disclosures.
  2. List of fund providers: Identify likely fund withdrawers and patterns, including sensitivity to funding composition changes.
  3. Withdrawal estimates: Assess potential deposit and fund withdrawals over different time horizons and identify funding sources.
  4. Internal limits and asset disposal: Set borrowing limits for subsidiaries and branches, determine acceptable risk premiums, and sequence asset disposals.
- The plan involves key departments like the money desk and Treasury for daily liability funding.

## Liquidity risk, unexpected deposit drains, and bank runs

Major liquidity problems can arise, however, if deposit drains are abnormally large and unexpected, which may occur for a number of reasons, including:

- Concerns about a DI’s solvency relative to those of other DIs.
- Failure of a related DI (the contagion effect).
- Sudden changes in investor preferences regarding holding nonbank financial assets (such as T-bills or mutual fund shares) relative to deposits.

In these cases, unexpected deposit drains could trigger a _bank run_ that may eventually force a bank into insolvency.

In the worst case, a _bank panic_ may occur - systemic or contagious bank run on deposits of banking industry.

## Bank runs, the discount window, and deposit insurance

The two major liquidity risk insulation devices are __deposit insurance__ and the __discount window__.

1. Deposit insurance
2. Discount window:
    - A facility provided by central banks where FIs can borrow short-term funds to meet liquidity needs, typically at an interest rate called the "discount rate."
    - During the March 2023 United States bank failures, banks drew $153 billion from the discount window as of 15 March 2023, a new record.

Not without economic costs

- Protection may encourage DIs to increase liquidity risk


# Liquidity risk at other types of financial institutions

## Life insurance companies

- Life insurance companies hold cash reserves and liquid assets to meet policy cancellations (surrenders) and working capital needs.
- Premium income and returns on investments usually cover policyholder surrenders, with government bonds serving as a liquidity buffer.
- If premium income is insufficient, insurers may sell liquid assets to meet demands.
- A loss of confidence in an insurer can lead to a run, with mass policy surrenders forcing asset liquidations at potentially low prices.
- Forced liquidations can push insurers towards insolvency, similar to banks (DIs).

::: {.callout-note}
An example is the case of [Equitable Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Equitable_Life_Assurance_Society). Increase in surrenders after it received an adverse legal ruling contributed to its failing. Its 256-year history ended in June 2018, after an 18-year-long winding-down process.
:::

## Property-casualty insurers

- Property–casualty (PC) insurers sell policies insuring against certain contingencies impacting either real property or individuals.
- Large unexpected claims may materialize and exceed the flow of premium income and income returns from assets.
    - For example, natural disasters.
