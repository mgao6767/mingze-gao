# Background

## Financial system

A __financial system__ encompasses various _financial intermediaries_, markets, regulators, and infrastructure in the generation and distribution of financial resources. 


> A well developed smoothly functioning \textit{financial system} facilitates the efficient life-cycle allocation of household consumption and the efficient allocation of physical capital to its most productive use in the business sector [@Merton1993].
> 
> Robert Merton, Nobel laureate (1997)

## Financial intermediation

__Financial intermediation__ is part of the financial system.

- It is the process by which financial intermediaries, such as banks, facilitate the flow of funds between savers and borrowers. 
- Banks are a major part of financial intermediation.
    - Banks were essentially the only provider of financial intermediation.
    - Since 1970s, dramatic development development of the financial market:
        - Other intermediaries performing similar functions of banks.
        - FinTech, bigtech in money and credit services.
        - Cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies.
        - ...

## Why is banking and financial intermediation necessary?

A historical perspective:

- **Finance is critical in real economic activities.**
    - Excessive debt levels and liquidity constraints could lead to downward spirals in economic activity, as witnessed during the Great Depression [@Fisher1933][^1]
- **"Finance is a veil", late 50s to early 70s.**
    - In a frictionless market, firm value is not affected by its capital structure so that financial intermediaries can be redundant [@Modigliani1958].
- **Finance is relevant, since 70s.**
    - Market frictions amplify economic cycles, particularly during downturns. Monetary factors alone are insufficient to explain the Great Depression's depth and persistence - it's more because of the collapse of the bank credit [@Bernanke1983, the "financial accelerator"].

[^1]: Nobel prize in economics started in 1969. Irving Fisher died in 1947. He would have won a Nobel prize.

## Why is banking and financial intermediation necessary?

A banking analogue of the @Modigliani1958 theorem showing that banks are useless with perfect financial markets.

- An economy of firms, households, banks and a bond market.
    - Households consume, and lend through banks or through the bond market.
    - Firms produce, and borrow from banks or from households through the bond market.
    - Banks borrow from households and lend to firms.

In a competitive equilibrium, banks make zero profit and have no impact on other agents' decisions. Firms are indifferent between bank credit and bonds.

- Banks and bond market are perfect substitutes in a market without frictions.

## Why is banking and financial intermediation necessary?

The existence of banks (and other financial intermediaries) must be justified by their roles in __mitigating market frictions__. 

- Information asymmetry.
- ...

From an industrial organization perspective, the structure and competition of banking sector should have a unique impact on the economy, which warrants for regulation.

- The services provided by banks to borrowers and savers must be costly.
    - Monitoring costs.
    - Liquidity costs.
    - ...

## Empirical evidence

# The specialness of bank and financial intermediaries

## Importance of banks and financial intermediaries

We start this banking course by studying the importance of banks in improving the efficient allocation of financial resources in the economy.

- Specifically, why market frictions necessitate banks.
- A simple look at the @Diamond1983 model.

## An economy without financial intermediaries

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
### The @Diamond1983 model
:::

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
%%| label: fig-economy-without-fi
%%| fig-cap: "A simple diagram of an economy without financial intermediaries"
graph LR
    A["Households (savers)"]  -- cash --> B["Firms (borrowers)"]
    B -- "financial claims (debt or equity)" --> A
```

Some _frictions_ render this setup unappealing.

- Households are uncertain about when they will need their money. They might need it either in the short term or in the long term.
- Firms need long-term capital in production.
- _Banks_[^bank] are best positioned to perform __maturity transformation__.

[^bank]: We later define what is a _bank_. 

## Model setup

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
### The @Diamond1983 model
:::

Let's see a simplified @Diamond1983 model:[^model]

[^model]: Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig won the Nobel price in 2022, together with Ben Bernanke.

- Three dates, $t=0,1,2.$
- Each household has initial goods of 1 unit at $t=0$.
    - They can invest long-term to earn $R>1$ at $t=2$ for consumption, or 
    - store it for consumption at $t=1$ or $t=2$, which remains 1 unit.
    - If they choose to liquidate the long-term investment at $t=1$, they get $l<1$ (costly liquidation).
- Household do not know whether they need to consume early at $t=1$.
    - A sudden need for money, e.g., medical bills (note there that we do not introduce insurance - but banks can provide such liquidity insurance).
    - Key assumption.

## Model implications

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
### The @Diamond1983 model
:::

Not bothered by math, the implications are:

::: {.incremental}
- We can determine the theoretical optimal allocation.
- Without transactions between agents, the allocation is inefficient.
- With transactions (financial market/bond market), the allocation is still not efficient.
    - Consumption can be transferred between $t=1$ and $t=2$.
    - Liquidation costs avoided.
- __The optimal allocation can be achieved with competitive banks offering deposit contracts and investing in the long-term.__
    - A ___bank___ simultaneously take deposits from the public and grant loans to borrowers.
    - Transform short-term deposits to long-term assets.
:::

## Maturity transformation by bank

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
### The @Diamond1983 model
:::

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
%%| label: fig-maturity-transformation
%%| fig-cap: "A simple diagram of bank's maturity transformation"
graph LR
    A1["Saver 1"]  -- "short-term deposits" --> B["Bank"]
    A2["Saver 2"]  -- "short-term deposits" --> B
    A3["Saver 3"]  -- "short-term deposits" --> B
    B -- "long-term loans" --> F1["Borrower 1"]
    B -- "long-term loans" --> F2["Borrower 2"]
```

- This structure, however, gives rise to _bank runs_ where everyone withdraws at $t=1$.
    - The Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failure in March 2023 is a typical bank run.
- No other risks considered.

## Beyond maturity transformation

Asset transformation, risk transformation and liquidity transformation.

- Banks make investments in borrowers - primary claims - illiquid and risky.
- Savers deposit in banks - secondary claims - liquid and low risk.

## Information frictions

Banks do more than maturity transformation. 

Banks are also better positioned to mitigate informational frictions in the market due to __economies of scale__.

- The cost advantages by spreading _the costs_ over a large number of customers, transactions, and output.
- The costs arise from all aspects of lending process: screening, monitoring, and auditing; all of which can be costly for individual household lenders.

## Information asymmetry and costs

- __Screening__ costs in the context of _adverse selection_ [@Broecker1990].
    - Borrower knows better about its quality than lenders.
    - Occurs before a loan is made.
- __Monitoring__ costs in the context of _moral hazard_ [@Holmstrom1997].
    - Borrower could engage in opportunistic behaviour with private benefits at the cost of lenders.
    - Occurs after a loan is made.
- Auditing costs in the context of borrower failing to meet contractual obligations.
    - Renegotiate loan terms, recover loan value, etc.
    - Occurs in case of non-compliance.

## Banks as delegated monitor

@Diamond1984 model, overly simplified:

- $n$ large borrowers, each requires $1$ unit of funds and costs $K$ to monitor, and
- $nm$ small savers each with $1/m$ units of funds ($m>1$); a total of $n$ units of funds.
- Total monitoring costs is $nmK$ if savers individually monitor, but
- $mK$ if the bank acts as the monitor on behalf of savers.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
%%| label: fig-diamond-1984
%%| fig-cap: "A simple diagram of bank as delegated monitor"
graph LR
    A1["Saver 1"]  -- "1/m" --> B["Bank"]
    A2["Saver ..."]  -- "1/m" --> B
    A3["Saver nm"]  -- "1/m" --> B
    B -- "1" --> F1["Borrower 1"]
    B -- "1" --> F2["Borrower 2"]
```

## Banks as delegated monitor

Economies of scale is evident:

- Total monitoring costs reduced from $nmK$ to $mK$.
- Delegated monitoring reduces unnecessary duplication of monitoring costs.
- The more savers, the lower the cost per saver.

A caveat. It must be that the cost of delegation is smaller than the benefits gained from economies of scale. The delegated monitor needs to be monitored, too.

- Requirement is that the bank needs to be sufficiently diversified [@Diamond1984].

## The @Holmstrom1997 model

Key insights:

- Firms with profitable projects will still be _credit rationed_ if they do not have sufficient internal capital - they will not be able to raise capital from the market.
- Banks can alleviate this problem by providing credit to firms and monitoring borrowers.
- Banks improve the market.

## Changing dynamics

### FinTech, bigtech, and more

- Traditional "banks", taking deposits and grant loans, are facing increasing challenges.
- Global competition with other banks.
- Competition with nonbanks or "shadow banks".
    - Many of banks' functions can be now performed by nonbanks.
    - For example, FinTech firms may better reduce information asymmetry through screening and monitoring based on big data and advanced technologies (AI/ML), improved and customized services, and reduced cost of search and match with platform economy.
    - More importantly, nonbanks are not regulated or less regulated than banks.
- Central bank digital currencies (CBDC).
    - Increased funding costs for banks if households hold CBDC instead of bank deposits.
- Technological advancement.
    - Online/mobile banking simplifies transfer of funds.
- Transition from "originate and hold" to "originate and distribute" business model.

# The financial services industry

## Types of financial institutions

The Australian's central bank, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), classifies financial institutions into broadly three categories:[^fi]

[^fi]: [https://www.rba.gov.au/fin-stability/fin-inst/main-types-of-financial-institutions.html](https://www.rba.gov.au/fin-stability/fin-inst/main-types-of-financial-institutions.html)

1. Authorised depository-taking institutions (ADI)
2. Non-ADI financial institutions
3. Insurers and fund managers

## Authorised depository-taking institutions (ADI)

Financial institutions authorised by the Australia Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to carry out financial intermediation are called [authorised depository institutions (ADIs)](https://www.apra.gov.au/register-of-authorised-deposit-taking-institutions).

- These depository-taking institutions (DIs) are the focus of this course.
- Three DI groups in Australia: banks, building societies and credit unions.

| Assets       | Liabilities and Equity |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Loans        | Deposits               |
| Other assets | Other liabilities      |
|              | Equity                 |

## Banks

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
### Depositary-taking institutions (DI)
:::

- Banks are the largest depository institutions in terms of size.
- Major difference between banks and credit unions/savings institutions: banks have more varied assets and liabilities.
- Differences in operating characteristics and profitability across size classes - for instance, with regards to the size of the commercial loan portfolio.

## Largest banks globally

Four major banks: CBA, ANZ, NAB, and Westpac.

- national focus, "four pillars policy"
- offer corporate and retail banking services in Australia, NZ and Papua New Guinea
- they also operate in Asia, the US and the UK
- focus on lending (around 70 per cent).

Other major banks: Macquarie Bank, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Bank of Queensland, Suncorp, AMP Bank, etc.

## Credit unions and building societies
::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
### Depositary-taking institutions (DI)
:::

Credit Unions

- Mutual cooperative organisations that provide deposit facilities, personal and housing loans and payments services to their members, who are usually linked by way of some common bond
- Primarily provide deposit facilities, personal and housing loans and payments services

- In 2014 there were 84 credit unions in Australia, compared to 348 in 1992

Building Societies

- DIs that traditionally were mutually owned, but are increasingly issuing share capital
- Depositors are members of the society
<!-- - Licensed under Banking Act to undertake the business of banking -->
<!-- - Subject to Corporations Law for corporate governance -->
- In 2014 there were 9 building societies, compared to 31 in 1992
