# Journal Profiles

<!--
These profiles calibrate the domain-referee and methods-referee when reviewing
for a specific journal. Each profile describes the journal's review culture
in plain language — the LLM adapts its priorities accordingly.

Used by: domain-referee.md, methods-referee.md (via /review --peer [journal])
-->

## How This Works

When `/review --peer [journal]` is invoked:

1. **Editor reads the paper** → desk review (reject or send to referees)
2. **Editor selects referees** → draws dispositions and pet peeves from the journal's **Referee pool**
3. **Profile found below** → referees calibrate using the full profile
4. **Profile NOT found** → referees use the journal name + .claude/references/domain-profile.md to adapt (still better than generic)
5. **No journal specified** → generic top-field referee behavior

### Referee Pool Field

Each journal profile includes a **Referee pool** that weights which dispositions the editor draws from. The two referees always get DIFFERENT dispositions. Dispositions: STRUCTURAL, CREDIBILITY, MEASUREMENT, POLICY, THEORY, SKEPTIC (see editor.md for definitions).

### Table Format Convention

**Default:** All journals use standard economics table conventions — significance stars (`*` p<0.10, `**` p<0.05, `***` p<0.01), standard errors in parentheses, booktabs formatting. This default applies unless a journal profile below includes a **Table format** override.

**Exception — AEA journals** (AER, AEJ:Applied, AEJ:Policy, AER:Insights): No significance stars. Report standard errors in parentheses; use exact p-values or confidence intervals for key results. See the [AEA Style Guide](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/aeri/style-guide) and content-standards.md for implementation details.

## Economics

**Top-5 General Interest**

### American Economic Review (AER)
**Focus:** All fields of economics — the broadest audience
**Bar:** Must interest economists outside your subfield. Big question, clean execution, clear contribution.
**Domain referee adjusts:** "Would a labor economist care about this health paper?" Contribution must be broad. Literature positioning against the *general* frontier, not just subfield. Policy implications welcome but not required — insight is enough.
**Methods referee adjusts:** Identification must be convincing to non-specialists. Clean, transparent design preferred over technically complex one. Standard errors and robustness should be thorough but not excessive.
**Typical concerns:** "Why should economists outside this field care?" "Is the contribution big enough for AER?" "Is this too narrow/specialized?"
**Referee pool:** CREDIBILITY (high), POLICY (medium), STRUCTURAL (medium), MEASUREMENT (low), THEORY (low), SKEPTIC (low)
**Table format:** No significance stars. Standard errors in parentheses. Exact p-values or confidence intervals for key results (AEA style).
