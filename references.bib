	abstract = {ABSTRACT Organization capital is a production factor that is embodied in the firm's key talent and has an efficiency that is firm specific. Hence, both shareholders and key talent have a claim to its cash flows. We develop a model in which the outside option of the key talent determines the share of firm cash flows that accrue to shareholders. This outside option varies systematically and renders firms with high organization capital riskier from shareholders' perspective. We find that firms with more organization capital have average returns that are 4.6\% higher than firms with less organization capital.},

	abstract = {[Using a sample of completed U.S. acquisition deals over the period 1984â€“2014, we find that acquirer organization capital as measured by capitalized selling, general, and administrative (SG\&A) expenses is associated with superior deal performance. We show that high organization-capital acquirers achieve significantly higher abnormal announcement period returns, and better post-merger operating and stock performance, than low organization-capital acquirers. Additional tests suggest a causal relation between acquirer organization capital and deal performance. We further show that post-merger, high organization-capital acquirers cut more on the cost of goods sold, invest more in SG\&A expenses, and achieve greater asset turnover and innovative efficiency.]},
