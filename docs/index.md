# A Random Walk Away Finance.

Iâ€™m [Mingze Gao](https://mingze-gao.com), aka [Adrian](https://adrian-gao.com),
a PhD candidate in Finance at the University of Sydney. My research interests
are corporate finance, banking and market microcstructure. Here is the place
where I randomly write some seriousness or nonsense: ***a random walk away finance***.
