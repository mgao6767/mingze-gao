{ .annotate }

1. üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 50 is a half of 101, rounded down.

*[Finance 101]: "101" represents a basic beginning course.

The objectives are

- to introduce [modern finance topics](#course-notes) covered in undergraduate and postgraduate courses
- to experiment [interactive web-based technologies](#demo) in learning and teaching

!!! warning "Note"

    This is a proof-of-concept and _always_ a work-in-progress.

    It could take a relatively long time for me to "complete".
