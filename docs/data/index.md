# FRDS - Financial Research Data Services

!!! note
    The old [Research Data Services](/data/rds) has been deprecated and will be 
    merged into [frds](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds) in a future release.

[frds](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/) is a Python framework I authored that
aims to provide the simplest way to compute a collection of major academic
measures used in the finance literature, one-click with a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). It features:

* consolidation of major data sources such as WRDS, Federal Reserve Board,
  Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg and more.
* one-liner to compute major measures used in literature.

## Installation & Configuration

[frds](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/) requires Python3.8 or higher. To
install using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install frds
```
After installation, a folder `frds` will be created under your user's home
directory, which contains a `data` folder, a `result` folder and a default
configuration file `config.ini`:

```ini
[Paths]
base_dir: ~/frds
data_dir: ${base_dir}/data
result_dir: ${base_dir}/result

[Login]
wrds_username: 
wrds_password: 
```

You need to enter your WRDS username and password under the login section.

## Usage

To start estimating various measures, run `frds` as a module:

```bash
$ python -m frds.gui.run
```

Alternatively, run without GUI:

```bash
$ python -m frds.run
```

The output data will be saved as STATA `.dta` file in the `result` folder.

## Example Output

Below is an example output for
[`tangibility`](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/blob/master/frds/measures/tangibility.py),
defined as the Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) scaled by Assets (Total),
estimated for all firms in the Compustat Fundamental Annual. The result dataset
is saved in `/result/Tangibility.dta`.
